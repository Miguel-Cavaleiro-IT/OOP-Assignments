# OOP-Assignments
In order to store, present and hand in my assignments during the third period of the first year's Object-Oriented Programming subject, of the course IT in NHL Stenden university, in the acdemic year of 2025, I created this repository. 
This repository was made as an organized and easily accessible archive. In this repository I present every assignment from Week 1 all the way to Week 10, giving a clear picture of my OOP learning path. All of the coursework is stored in one location, making it a useful tool for future assessment and possible improvement.
